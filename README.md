# Javascript Loose Typing and Unexpected Operator Behavior
This example demonstrates how Javascript's loose typing system can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly with the + operator.
The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers but behaves differently based on the input types. When a string is passed, string concatenation occurs instead of numerical addition.
The solution demonstrates how to use type checking to ensure consistent behavior.
